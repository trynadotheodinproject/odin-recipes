   <h4>Step 2</h4>

74 degrees C)</li>

<li>Let it cool down, Shred the chicken and set it aside for later. We have <b>big</b> plans for this ingredient!</li>
   <h4>Step 4</h4>
<li>Hold each tortilla over an open flame from you gas stove using metal tongs for safety. Get a decent char all over for the best crunch!</li>
   <h4>Step 5</h4>
<li>pur about a half inch of enchilada sauce onto the bottom of a baking dish. Assort the totillas into a single layer on top. </li>
   <h4>Step 6</h4>
<li>Sprinkle with 1/2 of the chicken, 1/3 of the cheese, 1/2 of the sour cream, and 1/3 of the remaining enchilada sauce.</li>
   <h4>Step 7</h4>
<li>Repeat layers. Coat remaining tortillas thoroughly with some of the remaining enchilada sauce and arrange on top. Sprinkle with remaining cheese and top with any remaining enchilada sauce.</li>
   <h4>Step 8</h4>
<li>Cover and bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Cool slightly before serving.</li>
