This project demonstrates my new HTML and Git skills through various tasks like pushing, pulling, adding, cloning, staging, and committing with Git. It also showcases my proficiency in using command-line interfaces, creating HTML 
boilerplates accurately, and understanding file systems, webpage relationships, content organization, images, links, and linking paths within websites.
